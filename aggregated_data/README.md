# Aggregated data from Goldman Sachs

We have arranged permission to reproduce the Covid-19 datasets from the [Goldman Sachs platform](https://developer.gs.com/docs/covid/). This represents aggregated case data from various publicly-available sources, which GS have normalised. The Python script in this folder periodically fetches the latest data and saves it in CSV form to the repo.

You need to have a client ID and secret for the Goldman Sachs developer platform to be able to run the script yourself, but the datasets are made available under [these terms](https://developer.gs.com/docs/covid/terms).
